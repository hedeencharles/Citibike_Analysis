# **New York City Bike Data Analysis**


# About my project

## *Analysis located in [ANALYSIS.MD](https://duckduckgo.com) file.*
## Softwares used:
* ### Python & Jupyter Notebook
  * **Extract;** automated the Notebook to pull in a local directory of CSV files downloaded from [New York Citi Bike Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). 
  * **Transform;** automated the Notebook to perform data cleaning. This included taking care of missing data, matching datasets that structurally changed over the years (accomplished by removing all spaces and uppercase letters in column names), and 
  * **Load;** automated the Notebook to then concatenate all the CSV files into one DataFrame and exported the DataFrame to a CSV file called 'cleaned_2016_2020_05-10.csv'. This CSV file was then loaded into Tableau for visual analysis.
  * **Exploration;** utilized the Python Pandas and Matplotlib library to further analyze the combined CSV file. Here, I was able to identify outliers and other trends in the data before jumping into Tableau.
