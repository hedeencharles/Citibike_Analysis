### *What are the most popular start/end station locations, since 2016?*
  * The most popular <ins>**start**</ins> stations in New York are shown in the Overall total trips graph, which depicts the top starting stations. After evaluating top locations, I noticed the most popular stations are located near train stations and parks in downtown Jersey City. This information can provide insight for Citibike where to allocate bike placement and advertisements.</p>
  * The five most popular <ins>**end**</ins> stations in New York are the same as the top five start stations, but from the map we can see there are customers that ride into the city of New York and end their ride. The number of rides ending in New York has increased since 2016, as seen in the map depicting end station in 2020.
  * 'Grove St PATH' is the top overall start and end station for bikers. In 2020, we see Newport Pkwy become the top visited station (start and end). This station is located near the bridge that accesses New York City. The popularity of this station could be increasing because more people are riding into New York, rather than around Jersey City.
